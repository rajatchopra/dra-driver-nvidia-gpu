## Software support matrix

This page describes DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs v{{< param "driver_version" >}}.
GPU allocation and ComputeDomains can be enabled independently. If you enable
both, satisfy the requirements for both features.

| Component | Supported version / requirement | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | v1.34.2 or later.<br><br>Some features require enabling Kubernetes feature gates and can require newer Kubernetes versions.  Refer to [Feature gates](reference/feature-gates.md). | GPU allocation |
| Kubernetes | v1.32 or later; v1.34.2 or later is recommended. DRA is enabled by default in v1.34 and later. On v1.32 and v1.33, enable the `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate and the corresponding `resource.k8s.io` API groups. | ComputeDomains |
| Helm | v3.8 or later. | Both |
| NVIDIA GPU Driver | v565 or later for a direct installation. GPU Operator v25.10.0 and later uses v580 or later for DRA. | GPU allocation |
| NVIDIA GPU Driver | v570.158.01 or later for a direct installation. GPU Operator v25.10.0 and later uses v580 or later for DRA. | ComputeDomains |
| NVIDIA Container Toolkit | v1.18.0 or higher. | Both |
| Container runtime with CDI | CDI must be enabled. It is enabled by default in containerd v2.0 and later and CRI-O v1.27 and later. The DRA Driver uses CDI to expose GPUs to containers. | Both |
| Node Feature Discovery (NFD) | v0.18.2 or higher. The DRA Driver has no version-specific NFD API dependency. The driver requires NFD's NVIDIA PCI node labels to target the kubelet plugin. | Both |
| GPU Feature Discovery (GFD) | v0.18.0 or higher. GFD must generate the `nvidia.com/gpu.clique` node label. | ComputeDomains |

The GPU Operator owns the compatibility of the NVIDIA components that it deploys.

### Supported GPU hardware

Hardware requirements depend on the resource type and feature:

| Resource or feature | Hardware requirement |
|---|---|
| Full GPU allocation, time-slicing, or VFIO passthrough | NVIDIA Data Center GPUs |
| MPS multi-user mode | NVIDIA V100 or newer. This requirement applies specifically to `multiUser: true`. Refer to [MPS prerequisites](guides/mps.md#prerequisites). |
| MIG | A [MIG-capable data center GPU](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/#supported-gpus) with Ampere architecture or newer. |
| ComputeDomains | Grace Blackwell GPUs with Multi-Node NVLink, such as NVIDIA HGX GB200 NVL72 or GB300 NVL72. |

Check the GPU model and installed driver version on every GPU node:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,driver_version --format=csv,noheader
```

For ComputeDomain-specific software and node configuration, see
[ComputeDomains additional prerequisites](#computedomains-additional-prerequisites).

## ComputeDomains additional prerequisites

If you plan to use ComputeDomains, you also need:

- NVIDIA Driver v570.158.01 or later. The `IMEXDaemonsWithDNSNames` feature gate is enabled by default and requires this driver version. The ComputeDomain plugin will fail to start on older drivers unless `IMEXDaemonsWithDNSNames` is explicitly disabled.
- Multi-Node NVLink (MNNVL) hardware. Nodes must be connected via NVLink fabric, such as GB200 NVL72 and similar systems.
- A component that manages the `nvidia.com/gpu.clique` node label.
  Use GPU Feature Discovery (GFD), or set `kubeletPlugin.containers.computeDomains.gpuCliqueLabelEnabled=true` so the ComputeDomain kubelet plugin manages the label.


### Driver-managed IMEX

The default `resources.computeDomains.imex.mode=driverManaged` setting makes the DRA Driver create one `nvidia-imex` DaemonSet for each `ComputeDomain`.
On all GPU nodes where the `nvidia-imex-*` packages are installed, disable the host `nvidia-imex.service` systemd unit:

```bash
systemctl disable --now nvidia-imex.service && systemctl mask nvidia-imex.service
```

### Host-managed IMEX

By default the driver owns the `nvidia-imex` daemon lifecycle, per the requirement above. For clusters where the operator already runs `nvidia-imex` as a host service (for example through systemd), set `resources.computeDomains.imex.mode=hostManaged` to stop the driver from creating per-ComputeDomain `nvidia-imex` DaemonSets. This **inverts** the requirement above: `nvidia-imex.service` must be installed, configured, and left **running** on every participating GPU node. Also, the `nvidia-imex` service should be configured with
`IMEX_CMD_ENABLED=1` and `IMEX_CMD_UNIX_DOMAIN_PATH=/etc/nvidia-imex/imex_ctrl.sock` (configurable via Helm).

{{% alert color="warning" title="Warning" %}}
Some `nvidia-imex.service` units use `ProtectSystem=full`, which prevents the service from creating the default socket under `/etc`.
For these units, set `IMEX_CMD_UNIX_DOMAIN_PATH` and `resources.computeDomains.imex.hostSocketPath` to the same writable runtime path, such as `/var/run/nvidia-imex-ctrl.sock`.
{{% /alert %}}

Host-managed mode requires two Helm values together:

```bash
--set featureGates.HostManagedIMEXDaemon=true \
--set resources.computeDomains.imex.mode=hostManaged
```

- `featureGates.HostManagedIMEXDaemon` is an alpha gate that only unlocks setting `imex.mode=hostManaged`. It does not by itself change any behavior. Setting `imex.mode=hostManaged` without this gate enabled is a startup validation error (`helm install`/`helm template` fails immediately, and if bypassed, the controller and kubelet plugin pods will fail to start).
- `imex.isolation` selects the IMEX isolation strategy, and applies under both `driverManaged` and `hostManaged` mode. It must be set to one of:
  - `domain` (default) — workers of the same ComputeDomain share one channel ID. Under `driverManaged` mode the driver creates a separate IMEX domain and uses channel 0; under `hostManaged` mode the controller reserves a distinct channel per ComputeDomain in the existing shared host IMEX domain.
  - `channel` — intended to eventually give each workload a unique channel within an IMEX domain. Not implemented yet: setting it is a startup validation error regardless of `imex.mode`.
  - Any other value is a startup validation error.
- Changing `imex.mode` or `imex.isolation` on a cluster with active ComputeDomain workloads is not supported and is not enforced by the driver, drain and remove existing ComputeDomains first.

#### Host IMEX readiness check (Unix domain socket required)

Because there is no driver-managed daemon to report readiness under host-managed IMEX, the kubelet plugin validates the host `nvidia-imex` daemon itself at channel claim prepare time: it runs `nvidia-imex-ctl -q --u=<socket path>` chrooted into the driver root and requires a `READY` response before handing out a channel. A claim fails, and is retried, rather than succeeding silently, if the host daemon isn't reachable or ready.

To enable it:

1. On every participating GPU node, add to `/etc/nvidia-imex/config.cfg`:

   ```text
   IMEX_CMD_ENABLED=1
   IMEX_CMD_UNIX_DOMAIN_PATH=/etc/nvidia-imex/imex_ctrl.sock
   ```

   then restart `nvidia-imex.service` so it creates the socket file (IMEX config changes require a restart to take effect).
2. `nvidia-imex-ctl` must be present under the driver root alongside `nvidia-smi` (it ships with the `nvidia-imex` package).
3. If a non-default socket path is used, set `resources.computeDomains.imex.hostSocketPath` (Helm value, plumbed to the kubelet plugin as `IMEX_HOST_SOCKET_PATH`) to match. It defaults to `/etc/nvidia-imex/imex_ctrl.sock`.

After installation, follow [Validate host-managed IMEX](guides/compute-domain-workloads.md#validate-host-managed-imex)
to verify the created objects, channel injection, and Prepare retry behavior.

## Install prerequisites with NVIDIA GPU Operator

The [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html) is a Kubernetes operator that automates the deployment and lifecycle management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs in a cluster.

It can manage the following DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs prerequisites for you:

- NVIDIA Driver (v565+ for GPU allocation, v570.158.01+ for ComputeDomains). The GPU Operator installs a [default driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/platform-support.html#gpu-operator-component-matrix) that meets the DRA Driver's prerequisites. To use a specific version, see [Common chart customization options](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html#common-chart-customization-options) in the GPU Operator documentation.
- CDI enabled through the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
- Node Feature Discovery (NFD).
- GPU Feature Discovery (GFD), which can own the ComputeDomain `nvidia.com/gpu.clique` label when you do not enable driver ownership.

If you choose to install the GPU Operator, follow the [DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs install guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/dra-intro-install.html) in the GPU Operator documentation. It covers installing the GPU Operator with the NVIDIA Kubernetes Device Plugin disabled and installing the DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs.
